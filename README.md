World University Rankings Power BI Dashboard
Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard visualizes world university rankings data, offering insights into university performance across different regions, countries, and league classifications. It provides a user-friendly interface with interactive filters and a variety of visual representations for exploring the data.
Data Source

The data used for this dashboard was sourced from the Round University Ranking (RUR). RUR provides an in-depth analysis of university rankings globally, measuring institutions based on several performance indicators such as teaching, research, international diversity, and financial sustainability.
Features

The dashboard includes the following key visualizations and elements:

    University List with Rank & Score: Displays a list of universities ranked by score, allowing users to sort and explore performance based on rank.
    KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
        University Count: Total number of universities analyzed in the dataset.
        Average Score by Region: The average score of universities within each region.
        Total Score by Region: Cumulative score of all universities in each region.
    Interactive World Map: Pinpoints university distribution across continents, giving a geographical representation of university ranks.
    Region Breakdown: Visualizes the number of universities and total score across different regions (e.g., Asia, Europe, North America, etc.).
    Filters for Exploration:
        Region: Select universities based on their geographic region (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa).
        Country: Narrow down universities from specific countries.
        League: Filter by university league, such as Bronze, Copper, Diamond, Golden, Silver, or World League.

Visualizations Breakdown

    University Count by Region: Bar chart displaying the number of universities within each region.
